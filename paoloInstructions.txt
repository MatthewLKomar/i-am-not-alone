I made it work locally by exporting the project from glitch, 
deleting everything except for src/ and server.js

then doing: 
npm install express
npm install socket.io

then linking the libraries in index.html (I have no idea of how it even worked on glitch).
You can replace the p5 and p5.sound links with these cloud hosted ones:
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.1.9/p5.js%22%3E</script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.1.9/addons/p5.sound.min.js%22%3E</script>
